About Me
======
I am a PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at Stanford University. I previously studied at Loyola University Chicago and recieved a B.S. in Bioinformatics and a B.A. in Sociology in 2020. 

My primary research interest is improving care for people suffering from opioid use disorder. I prefer to focus on ways local public health departments can leverage policy and community action to improve their regions.
